### About:
This password manager is unfinished and should not be used for secure applications. It was merely used as a way for me to learn python and some cryptographic practices. 

In its current state, it can save encrypted data such as usernames, passwords and emails, in an organized fashion, giving them labels that can be sorted by date or alphabetically. Data can only be accessed using the registered master password.
